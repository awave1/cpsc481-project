## Project idea

Many students prefer using tablets, or even smartphones for notetaking. Knowing that such portable devices are most popular among high school and college students, using built-in camera on a smartphone or a tablet can help with tracking students' attendance. A student will simply have to scan the presented QR code (or enter a unique lecture number) and the system will record that student as attending. Some professors do not release any notes in order to motivate students to come to lectures. This system can also help to those who attended lecture but wanted to review the lecture notes/slides. Professor will be able to share documents with all attending students. Taking attendance can enhance the educational process. It also can verify student's identity to eliminate false registrations.
