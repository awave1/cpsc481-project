The total goal of this application is to allow teachers a student to have a way to ensure attendance to lectures, as well as providing an easy way to access and create course material.</p>\n<h2>Mobile App</h2>\n<p>This portion is very simplistic and is to be used only by the student. It has a camera functionality to scan a QR code for a lecture, and a list of classes previously scanned and its corresponding material for the student to look at.</p>\n<p>Prototype can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/0EoUSxMftfUeBKCAgXvhMlcJ/Mobile?node-id=0%3A1\">https://www.figma.com/file/0EoUSxMftfUeBKCAgXvhMlcJ/Mobile?node-id=0%3A1</a>.</p>\n<p><mark><b>Updated prototype</b></mark>: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/mxPuT1yHhmgBMarsVcv4e1/Mobile---modified?node-id=0%3A1\">https://www.figma.com/file/mxPuT1yHhmgBMarsVcv4e1/Mobile---modified?node-id=0%3A1</a></p>\n<h2>Web Browser</h2>\n<p>A much more complicated system. It provides sign up functionality for students and teachers to make an account. It is also the main utility for the teacher, where the teacher can create new lecture and class material, create a QR code to present on a projector and look at statistics on their class, for example who attended each corresponding class. For a student, itâ€™s mainly a web version to look at materials on their computers over their smartphones.</p>\n<p>Prototype can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/DGRrDAIeyOJMFvonws5GQs2w/Web?node-id=0%3A1\">https://www.figma.com/file/DGRrDAIeyOJMFvonws5GQs2w/Web?node-id=0%3A1</a></p>\n<p><mark><b>Updated prototype</b></mark>: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/10fXMGEsm4QMTn0HAPGQiJ/Web-modified?node-id=0%3A1\">https://www.figma.com/file/10fXMGEsm4QMTn0HAPGQiJ/Web-modified?node-id=0%3A1</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 17, 2019","title":"P3: Hi-fi Prototype"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/p3"}}
